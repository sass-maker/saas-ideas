# High Signal

Research brief updated: 2026-04-05

Signal intelligence for companies and sectors, driven by news, filings, docs, and related-entity shifts.

## Working Thesis

High Signal should sit in the middle between:
- a narrow stock up/down predictor
- a vague "predict all global trends" product

The strongest version is not "AI predicts everything."

It is:
- what changed
- who is affected
- what related entities move with it
- what direction the signal points to
- how confident the system is
- what evidence supports the view

## Product Shape

Track important changes around companies and sectors, then surface evidence-backed directional signals.

The system should ingest:
- news
- earnings / filings
- company docs and announcements
- pricing pages and changelogs
- sector and competitor updates
- community discussion where relevant

Then it should build relationships across:
- companies
- suppliers / customers
- peers in the same category
- sectors and sub-sectors
- products, launches, and features

And output:
- directional scenarios
- sector pressure changes
- related-company impact maps
- confidence + supporting evidence
- change logs over time

## What High Signal Is Not

- not a generic chatbot over finance documents
- not a pure stock trading tool
- not a prediction market
- not just "trend discovery"
- not just "news sentiment"

## Core Output Objects

- `Signal card`: what changed, why it matters, affected entities, confidence, sources
- `Entity page`: company, peer set, supplier/customer links, recent signals, score history
- `Impact chain`: event -> direct impact -> second-order impact -> watchlist updates
- `Scenario view`: base case, upside case, downside case, evidence for each
- `Evidence bundle`: linked filings, docs, posts, news, and prior internal signal history

## Best First Wedge

Start with one specific domain only, for example:
- AI infra / semiconductors
- Indian public markets
- enterprise SaaS categories

One market, one forecast horizon, one buyer.

## Best First Buyer

- market researchers
- sector analysts
- operators who track competitive shifts
- serious retail investors who want structured context

The first buyer should care about:
- seeing important changes early
- understanding spillover effects
- having evidence, not just a score

## MVP

- one market or wedge only
- one forecast horizon only
- company + sector watchlists
- entity graph showing related names
- daily or weekly signal digest
- evidence trail for every signal
- simple backtest / hit-rate view

## Research Snapshot

As of 2026-04-05, this space is real but fragmented.

There is no single clear incumbent for the exact wedge here. Instead, the market is split across:
- finance signal engines
- AI research copilots
- company / market intelligence platforms
- trend detection products
- forecasting and market-based prediction platforms

That matters because the earlier list was intentionally broader than a strict competitor list. It was not random, but it did mix:
- direct competitors
- adjacent products
- tangential products that solve nearby jobs

## Verified Competitor Tiers

### Tangent Products

These are worth watching, but they are not true direct competitors.

- [Danelfin](https://danelfin.com/)
  - AI scoring for public equities.

- [TrendSpider](https://trendspider.com/)
  - technical analysis and trader workflow software.

- [Quiver Quant](https://www.quiverquant.com/datasources)
  - alternative datasets and market signals.

- [Stockpulse](https://stockpulse.ai/)
  - social sentiment and market monitoring.

- [Kalshi](https://help.kalshi.com/en/articles/13823766-what-are-prediction-markets), [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/), [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/)
  - forecasting outputs through markets or crowd forecasts, not the same product shape.

## Why The Earlier List Was Not Random

The products were pulled in for three different reasons:

- direct competitors:
  - they already turn external signals into company or sector intelligence
- adjacent competitors:
  - they own the same research workflow or source layer
- tangent products:
  - they compete for the user's attention when the job is "figure out what happens next"

That means the earlier list was useful for landscape mapping, but only a subset should be treated as true competitors.

## Verified Feature Patterns Across The Market

The serious products in this category usually have some mix of:
- source ingestion from many external channels
- entity extraction and normalization
- watchlists and alerts
- source-linked answers or reports
- workflow integrations
- report or memo generation
- historical monitoring
- some kind of proprietary taxonomy or graph

The most common feature clusters are:

- `ingestion`
  - news, filings, transcripts, websites, jobs, social, internal docs

- `structure`
  - entity/event tagging, taxonomy, relevance, novelty, sentiment, metadata

- `monitoring`
  - watchlists, notifications, scheduled reports, webhooks

- `analysis`
  - summaries, Q&A, comparisons, signal scoring, forecasts, scenario output

- `outputs`
  - reports, memos, tables, graphs, decks, battlecards, APIs

- `trust`
  - citations, source previews, audit trails, first-party or premium content

## What Serious Products Already Have

- evidence-linked outputs
- alerts and monitoring
- entity and event classification
- enterprise connectors and APIs
- domain-specific workflows
- enough source coverage that they are not just "news + Reddit"

## What Still Looks Open

- clean spillover mapping from one event to peers, suppliers, customers, and second-order effects
- a stronger bridge between product signals and market / company signals
- transparent versioned signal history instead of one-off summaries
- signal hit-rate tracking by signal type
- a product that feels like "company futures intelligence" rather than "research assistant" or "trading tool"

## Data Sources Reality

The mature products do not rely only on news and Reddit.

They usually combine:
- public web data
- official company materials
- social / forum / community signals
- jobs and hiring signals
- licensed datasets
- customer-connected internal data

Also, many of them do not rely purely on scraping. They use a mix of:
- scraping
- official feeds
- APIs
- licensed content
- user-connected sources

## Recommended Source Roadmap For High Signal

### V0: Cheap, Fast, Enough To Prove Value

Use:
- news
- company blogs
- docs and changelogs
- pricing pages
- IR pages
- filings
- Reddit
- X
- niche forums

Goal:
- prove that the product can detect meaningful changes and explain why they matter

### V1: Better Company and Product Coverage

Add:
- job boards and hiring pages
- app store metadata and reviews
- G2 / Capterra / Reddit review-style sources
- YouTube / podcast transcripts where relevant
- GitHub releases and repo activity
- ad libraries and launch directories

Goal:
- make the signal graph richer and more product-aware

### V2: Premium Quality Upgrade

Add:
- licensed earnings transcripts
- reliable market / fundamentals datasets
- traffic and app intelligence
- better document feeds
- expert or channel-check style inputs if commercially justified

Goal:
- move from good prototype to serious research product

### V3: Customer-Specific Operating Layer

Add:
- customer forecast models
- CRM / pipeline data
- internal documents
- watchlists and custom taxonomies

Goal:
- turn the product from a general dashboard into a company-specific decision layer

## Scrape Everything? Not Quite

The right framing is:
- scrape what is public and stable enough to be useful
- use APIs where they exist
- license the expensive or high-value datasets later

The wrong framing is:
- scrape the entire internet first

Why that is a mistake:
- too much engineering before product value is proven
- hard to normalize low-quality sources
- legal and operational risk rises quickly
- most of the useful signal still needs entity resolution and relationship mapping

## What To Copy

- citations and evidence trails
- watchlists and scheduled monitoring
- entity / event normalization
- strong source-linking and source previews
- report-ready outputs
- clear confidence framing instead of fake certainty

## What To Avoid

- a generic finance chatbot
- one-number "AI score" without explanation
- starting with too many sources
- pretending weak evidence is a forecast
- shipping a beautiful dashboard before the signal logic is useful

## Strongest Differentiation

The moat is not "we also read news."

The moat is:
- relationship mapping
- spillover analysis
- cross-source evidence synthesis
- versioned signal memory
- a product that shows what changed and what likely follows

## Best Buildable Direction Right Now

Start with:
- one wedge
- one horizon
- one user
- one evidence-backed output

The strongest first cut is:
- event -> affected company map
- peer / supplier / customer spillover graph
- directional scenario with confidence
- evidence trail
- simple backtest

## Naming Note
