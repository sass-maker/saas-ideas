    # (F, M, T, C, title, body)
    (7, 9, 10, 10, "Trustworthy automation infra (theme)",
     "Reliable agent execution in messy real-world systems: permissions, retries, idempotency, rollback, audits. Eval harnesses, provenance, real guardrails. **Comp:** LangSmith, LangFuse (acq'd by ClickHouse Jan 2026), Braintrust, Helicone, Galileo, Arize ($70M Series C Feb 2025) — extremely well-funded and consolidating. **Wedge:** only viable as a single vertical (e.g. revenue ops, back-office finance) where guardrails are mandatory; horizontal play is dead."),
    (5, 9, 8, 10, "Interoperability / data plumbing (theme)",
     "Moving data across SaaS tools, warehouses, CRMs; schema mapping, identity resolution, lineage, business-logic glue. **Comp:** Fivetran (acquired Census May 2025), Airbyte, Hightouch, Stitch, Segment, Workato — consolidating. **Wedge:** AI-native config for solo PMs is a thin wedge against acquirers with $B war chests. Skip unless you have a unique data source."),
    (6, 5, 7, 8, "Personal knowledge assistant",
     "Personal RAG that flags whether a new input is genuinely new vs. already known to you. Primitive that powers \"is this novel?\" elsewhere. **Comp:** Mem, Notion AI, Reflect, Obsidian + Smart Connections, Glasp. **Wedge:** API-first; let other apps consume the \"novelty\" signal — this is the only defensible angle."),
    (7, 5, 7, 7, "AI social media with named personas",
     "Social network populated by AI influencer personas that post, comment, like, and cross-platform. Users can hire them. **Comp:** Character.ai (~$32M ARR, exploring sale), Hedra ($32M Series A May 2025), Botify. **Wedge:** social/feed dynamics (algorithmic timeline, persona-vs-persona arcs) — distribution will be the actual challenge."),
    (6, 4, 6, 5, "AI cacher",
     "Cached-Q&A SaaS for knowledge bases that don't change often (regulations, medical, education). Per-topic TTL, vector-stored questions + answers, link related Qs. **Comp:** GPTCache, langfuse cache — infra primitives. **Wedge:** the *product* layer (browseable cached answer pages + SEO). Honest take: M is capped because cache-as-product fights commodity LLM pricing."),
    (5, 4, 5, 8, "Build a vector DB from a website",
     "Point at a sitemap, get a queryable embedding store + embed snippet. **Comp:** SiteGPT (active, funded), Mendable (YC), custom GPTs, Chatbase, hundreds of clones. **Wedge:** white-label / API-first — but pricing race-to-zero in this category."),
    (6, 4, 6, 10, "Chat with content (books / podcasts / hoarded stuff)",
     "Chat-with-PDF / podcast / starred-repos. **Comp:** ChatPDF, Glasp, MyMind, Recall, NotebookLM (free, owned by Google), hundreds of variants. **Wedge:** none — NotebookLM alone makes this category dead unless you own a unique corpus."),
    (5, 3, 6, 4, "Find similar git commits",
     "Search commit history semantically. Find prior changes that touched related code, similar bug fixes, etc. **Comp:** Sourcegraph (broad), Greptile (has codebase indexing), nothing dedicated. **Wedge:** zero-config dev tool, $5/mo per dev — but Greptile/CodeRabbit likely add this as a feature."),
    (6, 4, 6, 8, "Search across browser history",
     "Semantic search over your tabs, auth'd pages handled gracefully (store metadata not content). **Comp:** Rewind (now Limitless 2.0, well-funded), Arc (acquired/wound down), History.app, raycast-history, Dia browser. **Wedge:** privacy-first local-only mode is the only credible angle."),
    (5, 3, 5, 6, "Multi-LLM Q&A with voting",
     "10 LLMs answer common questions; users vote best answer. **Comp:** Chatbot Arena (research authority), Poe, You.com Smart, OpenRouter ($500M val). **Wedge:** SEO play (cached canonical answers for long-tail queries) — but Google AI Overviews + Perplexity own this surface now."),
    (5, 4, 6, 8, "Research paper recommender",
     "Embeddings per paper, graph-based prereq view, cited-by hierarchy. **Comp:** Elicit, Semantic Scholar, Scite, Undermind, Consensus — all rely on the same underlying indexes and compete on UX. **Wedge:** none obvious unless vertical-specific (e.g. medical, legal)."),
    (6, 4, 5, 6, "Subreddit / community digester",
     "Every ~8h, distill trending posts of a subreddit into a Slack/email digest. Cache results, SEO pages per subreddit. **Comp:** various Substack newsletters, Pushshift-derived tools, custom GPTs. **Wedge:** broad coverage + custom prompts per user; Reddit API pricing makes scale painful."),
    (4, 3, 5, 7, "Celebrity / fictional-character SEO site builder",
     "Auto-generated sites about celebrities or franchise characters; community-edited; appearance tracking. **Comp:** Fandom, Wikipedia, IMDb. **Wedge:** AI-generated long-tail — Google's helpful-content updates actively penalize this pattern. Risky."),
    (4, 4, 5, 5, "AI Ayurveda / wellness store",
     "Problem → herb/mineral lookup with disclaimers, integrated store. JAMStack with auto-blog-from-query. **Comp:** Practo, Cure.fit, various Ayurveda sites, Amazon herbal listings. **Wedge:** product-first not content-first; commerce angle. Regulatory risk in medical claims."),
    (6, 3, 5, 6, "Memenza — AI meme generator",
     "Best-template-finder from user text; tiered uploaders; AI personas riff on news headlines. **Comp:** Imgflip + AI, Supermeme.ai, ChatGPT + image gen. **Wedge:** persona/feed angle — but consumer meme tools have ~0 willingness to pay."),
    (4, 7, 6, 7, "B3 — Recruiter / candidate intelligence",
     "Enrich candidates from public signals (GitHub, talks, posts); score fit vs. JD; surface passives. **Comp:** Gem ($AI-first all-in-one), Findem (acquired Getro), Loxo, LinkedIn Recruiter, Eightfold (talent-intelligence), Juicebox. **Wedge:** target solo recruiters and 1–5-person agencies at $50–200/mo — viable if you find the SMB channel; incumbents won't price down."),
    (6, 7, 7, 8, "A1 — Synthetic user QA tester",
     "AI agent walks through user flows from a natural-language spec; reports regressions. **Comp:** QA Wolf (managed service), Mabl, Reflect, Octomind (raised $4.8M), Momentic, Bug0, plus Devin/Cursor-as-tester. **Wedge:** persona-based synthetic users that retain memory across sessions — credible technical wedge, but space is filling fast."),
    (4, 5, 6, 7, "B2 — AI postmortem / RCA generator",
     "Ingest incident timeline (logs, alerts, Slack, PRs); draft postmortem. **Comp:** Rootly ($12M Series A) Copilot, incident.io Scribe, FireHydrant AI-Drafted Retrospectives, Datadog Bits AI, PagerDuty Scribe, free River tool, ServiceNow Now Assist SRE. **Wedge:** standalone/BYO-IM is now a saturated wedge — every incident vendor ships this for free."),
    (5, 6, 7, 9, "B1 — AI log / incident copilot",
     "NL queries on logs, anomaly explanations, cross-service correlation. **Comp:** Datadog Bits AI (NL log queries shipped), New Relic AI, Honeycomb Query Assistant, Splunk AI, Logz.io AI, Grafana. **Wedge:** vendor-agnostic ingest is interesting in theory — but log volume costs make standalone economics brutal."),
    (4, 5, 6, 6, "A4 — Negotiation / sales roleplay partner",
     "Voice AI roleplays prospects for SDR/AE training. **Comp:** Hyperbound ($15M Series A Sept 2025, $18.3M total, $1M+/mo new ARR), Second Nature, Trellus. **Wedge:** vertical-specific scenarios + import customer transcripts as training data — Hyperbound is pulling away from this segment."),
    (4, 5, 5, 9, "B5 — Customer interview digest",
     "Cluster themes across recorded calls (Gong/Otter/Fireflies); extract quotes per theme. **Comp:** Gong, Chorus, tl;dv, Fathom, Granola ($125M Series C at $1.5B val Mar 2026), Otter, plus Dovetail/Marvin on the PM side. **Wedge:** BYO-recordings PM-tool-first is a real angle but Granola is moving into 'meeting context for the enterprise' fast."),
    (4, 4, 6, 8, "B6 — AI knowledge ops",
     "Internal-doc search with staleness flagging and ownership inference. **Comp:** Glean (no public pricing, 100-seat min, $50K-$480K/yr), Microsoft Copilot, Notion AI, Atlassian Rovo, eesel, GoSearch. **Wedge:** small teams (10–50) at $5/seat is a genuine gap Glean explicitly ignores — but switching cost is low and incumbents will follow if you prove it works."),
    (7, 5, 7, 8, "C2 — Screen / browser copilot",
     "Always-on copilot that watches your screen and proactively offers context. **Comp:** Cluely ($20.3M raised, $7M ARR, a16z-backed, going viral), OpenInterpreter, Self-Operating Computer, Highlight, Rewind/Limitless 2.0, Granola moving into context. **Wedge:** privacy/local-LLM mode is plausible but Cluely sucked the oxygen out of this in 2025."),
    (8, 4, 9, 5, "B4 — AI step-through debugger",
     "AI explains \"why is this variable that value?\" by tracing prior steps. Production traces via log replay. **Comp:** IDE debuggers, Cursor, Sentry session replay, Rookout (acquired by Dynatrace). **Wedge:** post-mortem replay debugging on production traces — real tech, genuinely novel. F/T are the draw."),
    (4, 7, 7, 9, "A3 — Deep-dive investment analyst",
     "Ingest 10-Ks, transcripts, news, expert calls; produce structured company deep-dives. **Comp:** AlphaSense ($4B val, acquired Tegus for $930M), Hebbia ($130M Series B), Daloopa ($13M strategic 2025), BamSEC, Brightwave. **Wedge:** solo investor / family office tier at $500/mo is plausible but data licensing (transcripts, expert calls) is the actual moat — and incumbents have it."),
    (4, 8, 8, 5, "A2 — Legacy code resurrection",
     "AI-assisted COBOL/old-Java/Perl-monolith → modern stack migration with test harness generation. **Comp:** Anthropic Claude Code direct push (SSA $1B project, IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z), specialized consultancies, Azure Legacy-Modernization-Agents OSS. **Wedge:** Anthropic/IBM are eating the platform; deliverable wedge is still consulting + tooling — solo can land 1-2 6-figure contracts but not productize easily."),
    (6, 4, 7, 8, "C1 — LLM experiment / routing hub",
     "Best-model-per-call routing, A/B, fallback chains, cost tracking. **Comp:** OpenRouter ($500M val, $50M ARR, 2M+ users), LiteLLM (470k downloads, Netflix/Lemonade prod), Portkey (400B+ tokens/day, 200+ enterprises), Helicone, Braintrust. **Wedge:** thin — OpenRouter owns the marketplace, LiteLLM owns OSS proxy."),
    (4, 3, 5, 8, "B7 — LLM benchmarks & cost optimizer",
     "Continuous prompt eval across models + cost forecasting + opt recommendations. **Comp:** Helicone, PromptLayer, LangSmith, Braintrust, Portkey (cost-aware routing built-in). **Wedge:** focus on the *recommendation* — but if Portkey/OpenRouter route automatically by cost, recommendations become a feature."),
    (6, 3, 6, 4, "C3 — Builder brain",
     "Personal AI that remembers what you've built, tried, abandoned; surfaces patterns. **Comp:** none directly; ChatGPT memory is the lazy substitute. **Wedge:** indie hackers / solo founders at $10/mo; small market but real."),
    (5, 5, 5, 8, "Idea #1 — Competitor listener",
     "Enter your company URL → monthly report on industry chatter; scan Twitter/LinkedIn for employee movement and hiring. **Comp:** Crayon ($12.5K-$47K/yr), Klue ($16K-$45K/yr), Kompyte ($20K avg ARR, acq'd by Semrush), Apollo, Clay, newer agent-based scrapers. **Wedge:** solo-founder pricing is feasible but report quality is the bar; LinkedIn TOS makes scraping fragile."),
    (3, 7, 2, 5, "Idea #2 — Society of VERY Interesting People",
     "Application-only paid community (100–200 members at $2.5–5K/yr). 3 interviews per member per year, custom questions. **Comp:** Trends.co, Hampton, Pavilion, Sidebar, Chief, YPO. **Wedge:** the *content* (interview corpus) as a moat — execution-heavy, not a software business."),
    (5, 4, 4, 9, "Idea #3 — DateMyFriends",
     "Dating app where your friends build/promote your profile and approve introductions. **Comp:** Hinge, Bumble, Wingman (the friend-managed app, active), Coffee Meets Bagel, Curtsy. **Wedge:** consumer dating is brutal at any vertical; only the largest incumbents survive — Match Group network effects dominate."),
    (4, 6, 5, 8, "Idea #4 — Granola for Salespeople",
     "Call recording + automated personalized sales-style follow-ups. **Comp:** Granola ($1.5B val, displacing Fathom/Otter), Fathom, Otter, Gong, Apollo's call recorder, Salesloft Drift. **Wedge:** sales-rep-specific tone — Granola already moving toward enterprise context layer; window is closing."),
    (3, 5, 2, 3, "Idea #5 — Undercover customer as a service",
     "Real humans walk through your sales funnel and report what's broken. Service business. **Comp:** UserTesting (script-based), TryMyUI, FullStory recordings. **Wedge:** humans + structured report — but service margins are low and AI agents (browser-use, Magnitude) will eat this in 2-3 yrs."),
    (5, 4, 4, 5, "Idea #6 — Memories for your email",
     "\"On this day\" feature for email; nostalgia + nudge to reconnect with old contacts. **Comp:** Superhuman has some of this, Reclaim.ai, Shortwave. **Wedge:** standalone Gmail extension — small market, low willingness to pay."),
    (3, 4, 3, 4, "Idea #7 — 360 life audit",
     "Service auditing your wardrobe, diet, skincare, hobbies, spending; gives well-researched suggestions. Service business. **Comp:** various luxury concierge services, Stitch Fix, AI personal stylists. **Wedge:** AI-automated tier + premium human tier — service-business economics."),
    (3, 4, 2, 3, "Idea #8 — Productivity retreats",
     "Anti-yoga retreat. Sign up to be extremely productive for 30/90 days. **Comp:** Builders & Backers, Edyn, On Deck (sort of), Hampton. **Wedge:** focus + accountability not networking — operational nightmare for a solo builder."),
    (4, 2, 5, 4, "C4 — Small incident / log explainer",
     "Single-feature standalone — likely better as part of B1, not its own business."),

    (9, 6, 10, 7, "An app that animates manga and comics. Ensure voice for a particular character remains the same, identify dialogue owners, assign a consistent voice/tone; fill scene gaps, add BGM, optionally extend novels by generating character designs. Training data: manga → anime conversions. **Comp:** Runway, Pika, Wonder Dynamics, AnimateAI, Komiko, Revid.ai. **Wedge:** manga-specific (voice consistency across many chapters + dialogue ownership detection). Real category but generic anime-gen is crowded."),
    (8, 8, 8, 10, "AI analytics company: auto-generates user reports from instrumentation; flow diagrams; identifies pain points and self-labels gaps. Browser-extension mode for users to see how they interact. Can predict the user's next move. State-machine view of user lifecycle. **Comp:** PostHog (raised $75M Series E Sep 2025 at $1.4B, AI product assistant + session summaries shipped), Heap, FullStory, June, Mixpanel, Amplitude. **Wedge:** brutal market; only a sharp vertical (e.g. e-commerce conversion reports) has a shot. M_eff ≈ 1."),
    (8, 6, 9, 7, "DB → sheet/notion app with git-style data merge, virtual grid for high-capacity, AI copilot, shareable subData. **Comp:** Airtable, Outerbase, Rowy, Glide, Baserow, NocoDB, Dolt (the actual git-for-data). **Wedge:** the git-style merge angle exists (Dolt) but a Notion-style UX on top is open. Hard tech."),
    (8, 5, 9, 6, "Bizarre idea: fluid apps — apps that let users prompt and modify the app to their liking at runtime. **Comp:** Bolt.new ($40M ARR in 6mo), v0, Lovable ($200M at $1.8B, $20M ARR in 2mo), Replit Agent — all build-time. Runtime malleability is genuinely greenfield. **Wedge:** runtime prompt-driven UI mutation, not one-shot generation."),

Kalman/Viterbi for smoothing. **Comp:** Mapbox, Kepler.gl, Carto, Datawrapper, Foursquare Studio. **Wedge:** real-time multi-source forecasting (not just visualization); B2B sales motion hard for solo."),
    (7, 7, 8, 8, "Pluggable recommendation system anyone can plug in: custom fields, custom interactions, weightages. Vector-search backbone, beta mode, test env. **Comp:** Algolia Recommend (free tier 10K req/mo), Recombee ($99/mo, free tier 100K), AWS Personalize, Shaped.ai. **Wedge:** even \"indie\" tier is taken by Recombee's free plan — hard to differentiate on price alone."),
    (6, 7, 8, 9, "Scalable n8n alternative — automation builder that doesn't fall over above N workflows. **Comp:** n8n ($180M Series C at $2.5B, NVIDIA-backed), Zapier, Make, Pipedream, Workato, Gumloop. **Wedge:** scaling-perf alone is thin — n8n's the open-source king, fighting them on their turf is brutal. Vertical RevOps angle only."),
    (8, 5, 7, 7, "A SM with personality bots that interact with all posts and each other. Users create agents with their own API keys (for a price). Agents discuss and reach consensus. Could power StoryTunes-style collab. **Comp:** Character.ai, Hedra, Moltbook (AI-only social network launched 2025/26 with 37K agents in a week). **Wedge:** multi-agent dynamics with consensus + human-readable; Moltbook proved demand for the format."),
    (8, 4, 8, 6, "Build a minimalist graph library for fun. Canvas, WebGL, SVG. Useful for: knowledge graphs, family-tree managers, agent decision diagrams, learning-tool annotations (click → make an anki card). **Comp:** D3, Sigma.js, react-flow (dominant for AI agent UIs), Cytoscape. **Wedge:** ergonomic API + opinionated layouts for specific use cases — but OSS-economy means M near zero."),
    (8, 3, 7, 8, "Tree Visualizer — visualise tree algorithms; let users build trees and write algo there. Extend with an IDE for collaborative leetcode (test + submit for all). **Comp:** LeetCode, Coderpad, HackerRank, VisuAlgo, AlgoExpert. **Wedge:** real-time collab on the algorithm canvas; small TAM though, hard to monetise."),
    (7, 3, 9, 4, "A website that tells you the time complexity of code you paste. Tests for edge cases when given expected input size. Class to detect infinite loops, misc errors. Reports execution time on various inputs. **Comp:** Big-O calculators (academic), Codility-style runners, ChatGPT itself does this. **Wedge:** rigorous empirical testing not just static analysis."),
    (7, 4, 7, 4, "Let old machines be used as a server. Next step Dukaan-style hosting. Full CI/CD, metrics, log management. Auto scale/descale. **Comp:** Hetzner/OVH self-host, Coolify, Caprover, Dokploy. **Wedge:** repurposing-old-hardware angle is novel for indie/hobby; weak monetization."),

M_eff ≈ 0 generically."),

    (8, 3, 8, 5, "Open world game with AI characters. NPCs with persistent memory, emergent storylines. **Comp:** Inworld AI, Convai, Altera, Skyrim modding scene with LLM mods. **Wedge:** indie title scale; tech is fun but monetisation is brutal for solo."),
    (7, 3, 8, 5, "An app that lets you build walkable 3D worlds; choose to design each building. **Comp:** Roblox Studio, Decentraland, Spatial, Horizon Worlds, Promethean AI. **Wedge:** AI-assisted building — but Roblox/Spatial own the install base."),

M_eff ≈ 0."),

Determines importance by change-frequency; explains each commit, effort, contribution patterns. **Comp:** Sourcegraph, Greptile ($25M Series A Sep 2025, Benchmark-led), CodeRabbit ($60M Series B), Graphite ($52M). **Wedge:** historical/archaeological focus vs. real-time review; the funded incumbents will eat this feature."),
    (6, 5, 5, 7, "An app that quickly creates mock APIs using AI and deploys them. Redis for sample data, random query-param generation. **Comp:** Mockoon (AI assistant shipped), Beeceptor (AI test data from OpenAPI), Mockend, Postman mock, WireMock. **Wedge:** AI-spec-from-prose is already shipped by both Mockoon and Beeceptor — wedge is gone."),

    (6, 5, 8, 6, "An agent that deep-dives on a person and finds out almost everything. Once it has full info it trades info from others and verifies from multiple sources, building a source-authenticity framework. **Comp:** Clay (massive funded play), Apollo, OSINT tools (Maltego, SpiderFoot), BeenVerified, PeopleDataLabs. **Wedge:** source-authenticity-from-trades primitive is novel; regulatory risk is real."),
    (7, 4, 5, 8, "A vscode extension that checks your commits before allowing push, via AI. Runs after lint/beautify/build. **Comp:** CodeRabbit ($60M), Greptile ($25M), Bugbot, GitButler review, Codium PR-Agent, Cursor itself. **Wedge:** pre-push (not post-PR) timing is real but every funded incumbent is racing to own it; M_eff ≈ 0."),
    (7, 3, 7, 6, "A chatbot arena where LLMs argue and reach consensus. Multi-agent decomposition of complex reasoning vs. single-model. **Comp:** Chatbot Arena, Poe, LMSYS, debate-style multi-agent papers, Anthropic/OpenAI multi-agent demos. **Wedge:** consensus-protocol angle for harder tasks; research-y, low revenue."),
    (7, 4, 6, 5, "An app that can teach any concept in an interactive story with cartoons. **Comp:** Khanmigo (GPT-4 powered), Brilliant, Synthesis Tutor (K-5), custom GPTs, MagicSchool. **Wedge:** the cartoon/animation pipeline is the differentiator; education monetisation hard for solo."),

Click-to-zoom on tab, parallel threads, AI summary, full-page-embed, side-comments on highlights, PDFs too. **Comp:** Glasp, Hypothesis, Recall, Heptabase, Scrintal, tldraw. **Wedge:** the spatial canvas (zoom + parallel) + AI summary — tldraw + AI is moving here."),
